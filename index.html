                    <p class="interest-text">
                        Auditing is one of my favorite concepts learnt in IT. the idea of being able to stop or reduce
                        the
                        currption and doing the right thing is what makes me most excited about it. I have not
                        experienced
                        it a lot, yet, I have taken one course about it back in university with Dr. Mohamed Altayeb
                        which
                        was himself an auditor at one point of his life.

                    <p class=" interest-text">
                        The ability to extract patterns and usedful data out of massive amount of data is incredibly
                        amazing! I have worked on two projects in unversity where we had to extract data and make
                        business decisions based on the data we have and I like it!

                        I have enjoyed managing and leading my teams throughout most of the projects I have worked on in
                        University and lately on my general assembly immersive course. One of the most successful
                        experiences was our senior project in university which we won the third place award on!
