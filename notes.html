strong, b, em, and i tags
<!-- 
    we have two tags that bolden the text which are <b> and <strong>.
    However, STRONG adds more meaning than B. use strong.

    we have two tags that italicize the text which are <i> and <em> (emphsize).
    However, EM adds more meaning than I. use EM.

tables structure:
<table>
    <!--tables also has header, body, and footer. you can ignore them, but they're useful for editing the style.
    *table has many attributes to style the table. however, they are DEPRECATED. no longer used. not recommended. better use css for styling.-->
    <thead> //the header
        <th>//the col name</th>
        <th>//the col name</th>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>//row 
            <td>the cell data</td>
            <td>the cell data</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>//row 
            <td>the cell data</td>
            <td>the cell data</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

    <tfoot></tfoot>
    <!--we can directly use the tags within the table without using thead, tbody, and tfoot since the output won't change.
    However, if we want to style the table and add some css and js, it would be useful to have the table nested properly.-->
</table>
